# snake 

<strong> Game written in pure Javascript. </strong> 

The main objective of the project was exercising my Javascript skills, including its application in the DOM. Project created after completing my first book on Javascript ("Headfirst Javascript Programming" by E. Freeman, E. Robson). 

<strong> Game features: </strong>
- interface - buttons for selecting game options,
- 3 different game sizes (with adjusted grid),
- 5 different difficulty levels,
- little extra effects (on snake's death, on eating food). 

<strong> Main challenges: </strong>
- The grid - it was a struggle to match the snake size and snake speed to different grid sizes, 
- The snake - the project was above my skills at the time - it took a lot of experimentation to understand how the snake needs to work, 
- The book I had completed didn't cover a lot of aspects that were essential for the project, especially related to performance/fixing lag issues - for example the window.requestAnimationFrame; for a novice like me - a lot of research and googling was required.

<strong> Lessons learned: </strong>
- Planning - I started coding too soon, before the plan for game's logic was complete - as a result, later on I had to fix problems with game's logic when a lot of code was already written, 
- Testing - need to rigorously test every new element I'm adding; I definitely didn't test often and soon enough, which made me waste a lot of time on debugging that could be avoided, 
- Systematic debugging - I need to check for the simplest errors first - typos, non-matching variables/links etc - I wasted quite a bit of time on the project because I was skipping that step.
