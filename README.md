# snake 

The main objective of the project was exercising my Javascript skills, including its application in the DOM. It was the first larger project I did entirely on my own. Started it after finishing my first book on Javascript ("Headfirst Javascript Programming", E. Robson, E. Freeman).

<strong> Game features: </strong>
- interface - buttons for selecting game options,
- 3 different game sizes (with adjusted grid),
- 5 different difficulty levels,
- little extra effects (on snake's death, on eating food). 

<strong> Main challenges: </strong>
- The grid - it was a struggle to match the snake size and snake speed to different grid sizes, 
- The snake - the project was above my skills at the time - it took a lot of experimentation to understand how the snake needs to work, 
- The book I had completed didn't cover a lot of aspects that were essential for the project, especially related to performance/fixing lag issues - for example the window.requestAnimationFrame; for a novice like me - a lot of research and googling was required.

<strong> Lessons learned: </strong>
- Planning - I started coding too soon, before the plan for game's logic was complete - as a result, later on I had to fix problems with game's logic when a lot of code was already written, 
- Testing - need to rigorously test every new element I'm adding; I definitely didn't test often and soon enough, which made me waste a lot of time on debugging that could be avoided, 
- Systematic debugging - I need to check for the simplest errors first - typos, non-matching variables/links etc - I wasted quite a bit of time on the project because I was skipping that step.
